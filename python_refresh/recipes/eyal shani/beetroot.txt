  Beetroot Carpaccio

The word carpaccio might have you immediately jumping to thoughts of thinly-sliced beef to start off a heavy, Italian dinner. For the carnivores among us, that’s just fine - but with more and more people around the world going vegan or vegetarian, reducing the amount of meat they eat or simply trying to add in more nutrient-packed veggies, this beetroot carpaccio is a welcome change from the regular. Tel Aviv is the vegan capital of the world, and this beautiful and tasty dish can be found at some of our best restaurants - and on your dinner table.

*Ingredients*

2 medium beets
1 bunch arugula leaves

Olive oil
Goat cheese (optional)

    Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Wrap the beets in foil and roast them in the oven for 1 hour or until soft. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Peel while the beets are warm.

    Slice the beets into very thin circles and place on plate as carpaccio.

 3.

    Brush olive oil, date syrup and balsamic vinegar on the beets and place the arugula leaves, cranberries, roasted pecans and cheese on top.
